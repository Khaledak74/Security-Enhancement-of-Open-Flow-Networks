# Security-Enhancement-of-Open-Flow-Networks
An SDN security project that simulates a DDoS attack on an OpenFlow-based network by flooding the controller with TCP SYN packets to disrupt services. The project implements automated mitigation techniques using traffic baselining, subnet checking, rate limiting, and load balancing to enhance network resilience and availability.
