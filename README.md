# Security-Enhancement-of-Open-Flow-Networks
This project focuses on analyzing and improving the security of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) environments using the OpenFlow protocol. It demonstrates a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack scenario by targeting a web server and flooding the SDN controller with TCP SYN packets, leading to service disruption and network unavailability.

The project then implements automated defense and mitigation mechanisms to detect and respond to the attack. These mechanisms include subnet validation, traffic baselining, dynamic rate limiting, and load balancing to protect the controller and maintain network availability. The goal is to enhance the resilience of OpenFlow networks against control-plane and data-plane attacks.
